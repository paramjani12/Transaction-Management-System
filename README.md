# Transaction-Management-System-SQL
Our database schema consisted of three databases  which records personal details, branch details and city information respectively. Database is made using SQL. We have used PL SQL for our transaction system where account number and transaction option is asked. According to the input of the user, transactions occur. Lastly the user's current balance is shown and updated in the database.
